# Machine-Learning-with-Python

Instead of writing our machine learning algorithms using Python, which works very well, we can use lots of modules and libraries already implemented in Python.

**NumPy**

NumPy is a math library to work with N-dimensional arrays in Python
Excelent to work with arrays, dictionaries, funcions, data types and images

To import the full library of NumPy:

```python

import numpy as np

```

**SciPy**

SciPy is a collection of numerical algorithms and domain specific toolboxes, including signal processing optimization, statistics and much more.
It's a good library for scientific and high performance computation

**Matplotlib**

Matplotlib is very popular for plotting package that provides 2D and 3D plotting.
A good asset for data scientists who want to work with real-world problems.

To import the full Library of matplotlib:

```python

import matplotlib as plt

```

To import only the pyplot module of Matplotlib, used for creating visualizations:

```python

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

```

**Pandas**

Pandas is a very high level Python library that provides high performance easy to use data structures.
It has many functions for data importing, manipulation and analysis.
In particular, it offers data structures and oparations for manipulating numerical tables and timeseries.

To import the full library of Pandas:

```python

import pandas as pd

```

**SciKit Learn**

SciKit Learn is a collection of algorithms and tools for machine learning.
It has most of the classification, regression and clustering algorithms, and it's designed to work with Python numerical and scientific libraries: NumPy and SciPy
